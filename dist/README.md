# FS19 Mod Install Checker

This little program will take a look at your mod install folder and inform you of the following

 * If a mod file is named incorrectly and won't load in the game.
   * Suggest it might be a copy if the name looks like a copy (and note if you already have it)
   * Suggest you extract it if it looks like a collection of mods

 * If a mod is not properly zipped.
   * Suggest that you zip it up

 * If a mod is used in your save games, but does not appear to be installed.

 * If a mod is not loaded or used in any of your save games

 * If a mod is loaded but unused in your save games.

 * If a mod you have possibly conflicts with another mod you have.
