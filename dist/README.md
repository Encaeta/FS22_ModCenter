# FS19 Mod Install Checker

This little program will take a look at your mod install folder and inform you of the following

* If a mod file is named incorrectly and won't load in the game.
  * Suggest it might be a copy if the name looks like a copy
    * Note if you already have that identical file
    * Note if you already have that version, but the files are different
    * Note if you don't have a properly named original
  * Suggest you extract it if it looks like a collection of mods

* If a mod is not properly zipped.
  * Suggest that you zip it up
  * Suggest you move the contents of the folder if it looks like a mod pack
  * Suggest you remove the folder if it looks like garbage

* If a file exists that is not a mod at all
  * Suggest you remove the file

* If a mod is used in your save games, but does not appear to be installed.

* If a mod is not loaded or used in any of your save games

* If a mod is loaded but unused in your save games.

* If a mod you have possibly conflicts with another mod you have.
