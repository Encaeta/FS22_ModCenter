Mod Assistant can be used with other versions of Farming Simulator - but this behavior is opt-in for a better first user experience

## Turning it On

To turn on multiple version mode, head to the preferences editor, located on the top bar - it's the `Gear` icon.

## Changing Game Version

To change the game version, use the dropdown beside the collection bar in the main interface.

## Setting Collection Versions

To set a collection to a specific game version, you can do 2 things

- Add that collection while in the correct version mode
- Edit the collection details and specify the game version

To edit a collection, hit the collection details button next to the `Savegame Compare` button
